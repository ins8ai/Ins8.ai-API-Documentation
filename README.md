# Introduction

Made for Asia. In Asia, most of us speak more than one language â€“ English, Mandarin, Malay, Tagalog and we integrate our vocabulary from these languages as part of our daily speech.
<n />
With our recognition API, Ins8.ai can help to understand your daily speech and transform them into highly accurate and usable transcripts for your business.
